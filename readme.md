# WMBF (weighted multi-bi-fidelity)


The corresponding code of the revising paper "*A novel multi-fidelity surrogate modeling method for non-hierarchical data fusion*" is updated in this program.

2023/11 : update the code of the demostration example in 4.1



Codes in different file folders refer to different methods, the 'WMBF_202311' one is ours.

main_demo1d.m is the main function file, which provide the main result of Section 4.1.

To run this demostration, all files should be included in Matlab path. Run "main_demo1d.m" can obtain the corresponding result as the variable 'Res' shown.
